                Hello, Iâ€™m ABD! Welcome to my personal portfolio! Like Ben Tennyson, I harness the power of various technologies, always ready to take on new challenges. I have a strong proficiency in Linux and am an AI enthusiast, diving into algorithms that empower machines to learn and adapt. As a moderately skilled MERN stack developer, I build dynamic web applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I also create cross-platform applications with Qt, ensuring user-friendly interfaces. My programming skills include C, Java, Python, HTML, and CSS, which I use to develop efficient algorithms and visually appealing web pages. My journey began out of curiosity and a passion for technology, and I embrace every project as an opportunity to learn and grow. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the realms of technology, diving into animation and sci-fi worlds, or experimenting with new programming languages. I'm always eager to connect and collaborate, so feel free to reach out!
